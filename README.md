# COVID-19 APP

This project aims to study the evolution of the **COVID-19** through a **web app* using the *streamlit library* and the use of **neural networks (LTSM)** to **time series forecasting**. 

The web app gets **actual COVID-19 data** from [CSSE at Johns Hopkins University data repository](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19) 
and from an [API](https://covid19api.com/) related to this data developed by [Kyle Redelinghuys](https://twitter.com/ksredelinghuys).
